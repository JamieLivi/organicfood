### Showcase React Native project

Demo (uses react-native-web): https://dev.d1uzshmek9lg0p.amplifyapp.com/

#### Features

- React Native front-end, supports iOS, Android and web
- Back-end built with AWS Amplify, including both REST and GraphQL API's backed by a dynamoDB table containing the data
- Image storage with S3
- The REST API has a single, read-only path using a NodeJS Lambda function (Serverless ExpressJS) to handle the HTTP requests and responses to the client-facing app
- The GraphQL API is accesible through an admin API on the web app only, protected by authorization using Cognito user pools. This provides create, read, update, delete functionality.

#### Project Brief

###### Introduction

This assessment isn't a pass or fail test, but something for us to assess where your strengths and weaknesses are and any decisions you make. It is also your chance to impress us and get a feel for the team you could end up working with, so do keep that in mind!
Please complete this and bring it to your interview or a link to your Github repo to talk through what you’ve done. Feel free to spend as much or as little time as you’d like on this, but remember you will be talking about this to some of the team so what you do here is your chance to impress.

###### Exercise

Create a react native application that uses data from a REST API. If you aren’t sure where to find one, there are plenty here: https://public-apis.io/ and we’re happy to use any you like, especially if it’s got data about something you are interested in.
You’ll create at least one list page and a details page using the data from the rest API – the rest is up to you! Add anything else that you think would show off your skills as the person we want in the team. Everything else is up to you.
When you have your interview, we’d like to see what you’ve done and talk us through your approach.
